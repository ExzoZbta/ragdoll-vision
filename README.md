# Handtracking in the browser with Google MediaPipe
---

[MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/docs/solutions/hands.md)

  ### **Basic Overview**
  - A brief experimentation demonstrating the user interaction capabilities via MediaPipe's handtracking feature. This project allows the user to play around with ragdoll physics by pointing at the screen with their index finger.
  - Utilizes the [Matter.js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js) library, a 2D rigid body physics engine for the web, for the ragdoll physics.

  ### **Usage**
  - [Demo, hosted with Glitch](https://ragdoll-vision.glitch.me/)
    - Please allow the browser to activate your device's camera. Make sure you are in a relatively well-lit room to ensure a smooth experience.
    - The green dot is the indicator of the tip of your index finger once it is in view of the camera.
